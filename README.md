How to setup Arduino

* Add the board from the Arduino board manager - search for RP2040 or Pico and add "Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040"
* Tested with version 2.2.2 - any newer version may work but you may need to use 2.2.2 if you have problems
* Change board to "Rapberry Pi Pico" and leave all other settings at default except for "USB Stack"
* Change "USB Stack" to "Adafruit TinyUSB"
* When uploading, first unplug and re-plug the Pico with BOOTSEL held down
